### Welcome to Chris's corner of the project!

In utilities you will find some helper functions that may be useful.

To set this up, you should run ```python build_utilities.py``` from inside the utilities directory. This will build the relevant networks and save them to disk for use in modularity calculations. You can see some examples of how to use the graph_utilities methods in networks.ipynb.
